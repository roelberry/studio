/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the Indiana Artivist Directory.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes ease of access for public content while maintaining security against unauthorized data modification.  The `artists` collection is publicly readable, allowing for easy display of the artist gallery and profiles. Write access (create, update, delete) is implicitly limited to admin users via manual Firebase console management, as this is intended to be a curated directory and a class project with a short deadline.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized under the top-level `/artists/{artistId}` collection.  Each document represents an artist or collective and contains all the information needed for their gallery card and profile page.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access:  The ruleset allows unauthenticated users to `get` and `list` artist data.
 * - Admin-Only Writes: Write operations are not explicitly secured in code.  It is expected that all write operations will be performed manually within the Firebase console by authorized administrators only.
 * - No User Listing:  There is no concept of user accounts or user-specific data in this initial project.
